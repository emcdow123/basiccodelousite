# basiccodelousite
Code Louisville Project

Practice some Git, some HTML, and some CSS

Start by cloning this repo to your local machine:
1. Navigate to a folder where you want to pull this repo down to, I recommend creating a "development" folder in your "My Documents" folder, or something along this line (also, do all of this in the command line)
2. Clone the repo "git clone https://github.com/emcdow123/basiccodelousite.git"
3. And now you have the repo on your local machine!

Create a new branch, and call it anything you want:
git checkout -b WHATEVERYOURWANTYOURBRANCHNAMETOBE
git branch (to make sure that worked, and you're in the right branch)

Modify the index.html file, add your own section with your name in the class, I.E. "erics-section"

Put whatever you want in your section, and then using a comment in the main.css file, add some styling that only effects your section of the HTML

Commit your changes in your branch.

Push your branch up to this repo:
git push -u origin WHATEVERITWASTHATYOUNAMEDYOURBRANCH

Then we'll see how to do a pull request.
